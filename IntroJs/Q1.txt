JavaScript is a scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive web content. 
It allows developers to manipulate webpage behavior, handle user interactions 
(e.g., clicks, form submissions), update content without reloading the page 
(via AJAX or Fetch API), and manage asynchronous operations. 
Alongside HTML (structure) and CSS (styling), 
JavaScript is a core technology for front-end web development. 
It also extends to server-side programming (e.g., Node.js) and 
powers frameworks like React and Angular for building complex applications.
