Working Directory: Where you edit files (untracked or modified).

Staging Area (Index): Files added with git add are staged for committing.

Repository (Local/Remote): Commits (git commit) save staged changes permanently.

Push to remote repositories (e.g., GitHub) with git push.


Example :

git add .          # Stage all changes  
git commit -m "Fix login bug"  
git push origin main
