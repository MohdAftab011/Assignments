Version control is a system that tracks changes to files (e.g., code, documents) over time. 

It allows developers to:

Revert to previous versions.

Collaborate without overwriting work.

Track who made changes and why.

Manage parallel development (e.g., via branches).
Importance: Prevents code loss, enables teamwork, and simplifies debugging by maintaining a history of changes.
