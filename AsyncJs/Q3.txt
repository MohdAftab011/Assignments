Same-Origin Policy
The same-origin policy is a security feature implemented in browsers to restrict how resources from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.

An origin is defined by the protocol, host, and port of a URL.
For example:
http://example.com:80 and http://example.com:8080 are considered different origins because of different ports.
http://example.com and https://example.com are different origins due to different protocols.
The policy ensures that scripts running on one origin cannot interact with resources from another origin unless explicitly allowed. This prevents malicious cross-site attacks.
